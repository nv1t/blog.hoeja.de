    You: For the good of all of us.
    Stranger: Except the ones who are dead.
    You: but theres no sense crying over every mistake
    Stranger: You just keep on trying til you run out of cake
    You: And the science gets done
    Stranger: And you make a neat gun
    You: for the ones that who are
    Stranger: STILL ALIVE
    You: I'm not even angry...
    I'm being so sincere right now-
    Stranger: Even though you broke my heart
    Stranger: And killed me
    You: And tore me to pieces.
    Stranger: And threw every piece into a pile
    You: As they burned it hurt because
    I was so happy for you!
    Stranger: Now these points of data make a beautiful line
    You: And we're out of beta.

    Stranger: So I'm glad I got burned thinking of all the things we learned
    You: for the people who are
    still alive.
    Stranger: Go ahead and leave me...

    You: Maybe you'll find someone else
    Stranger: to help you.
    You: maybe Black Mesa? That was a joke! Fat Chance!
    Stranger: Anyway, this cake is great, its so delicious and moist.

    You: And believe me I am 
    still alive.
    Stranger: I'm doing science and I'm still alive
    You: I feel fantastic and I'm
    still alive.
    Stranger: While you're dying I'll be still alive
    You: And when you're dead I will be
    still alive.
