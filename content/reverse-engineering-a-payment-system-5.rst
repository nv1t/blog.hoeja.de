I didn't write about it, in a long time. Just to keep a few facts
straight. It has been cracked. I gave a talk about it, with my little
knowledge base...a team formed and it got cracked in no time. I'm not
posting any information here. you don't know, where the card belongs to
and i'm not gonna tell. Neither, i'm going to tell how it is stored. It
was a long process encrypting it. We can change the amount of money and
have the bit masks for the price storage. I'm not going to blog about
it, any further. If the system is changed in a few years, probably we
will open up the information, but not yet. so long
