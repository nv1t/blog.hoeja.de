I thought it wouldn't work...but apparently, something happend. A few
days ago, i checked a local RFID System...I wanted to know, how it is
working and so on... The card looks something like this:

 .. code-block :: plain

    0000000: adb0 a0a3 1e88 0400 468f 3658 5570 3710  ........F.6XUp7.
    0000010: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
    0000020: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
    0000030: c0c1 c2c3 c4c5 7f07 8800 bcbc bcbc bcbc  ................
    0000040: 4445 0000 xxxx xx00 0000 0000 0000 0000  DE..xxx.........
    0000050: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xx00 0000 0000  xxxxxxxxxxx.....
    0000060: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
    0000070: 3636 3636 3636 7f07 8800 dede dede dede  666666..........
    0000080: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
    0000090: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
    00000a0: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................

the x'es represent numbers on the card. i blanked them out, coz they are
mine ;) I thought, the uid, which is stored on the card, has to be
looked up in a database. So i figured, let's try a sql injection:

 .. code-block :: plain

    0000040: 4445 0000 xxxx xx00 0000 0000 0000 0000  DE..xxx.........
    0000050: 3030 2220 6f72 2031 3d31 2200 0000 0000  00" or 1="1.....

and what do you know....the application didn't say it can't read the
card...it just went down...the application crashed with some kind of
error, which was written in dutch. I don't know what happend, i think i
may have overburdened the server with this request. But ... why?!?
That's the worst security error i discovered in a looong time. And it
gets even better...which is another bedtime story ;) so long
