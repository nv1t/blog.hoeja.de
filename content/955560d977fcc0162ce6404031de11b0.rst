For some moral issues and personal thought i protected the tweets of
nuitgaspard. Some pictures showed christmas trees and rooms of their
tweeting owners. I didn't want to expose them too much. Everybody can
see, if he gets picked from twitpic and the tweeter gets a mention about
this picture. I'm sorry for all those public available GPS information.
Hopefully it didn't harm anybody. so long
