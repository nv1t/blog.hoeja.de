### Amazium template for Pelican

The template is based off the [Amazium CSS Framework](http://www.amazium.co.uk/) which I created for
my own website that runs [Pelican.](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/)
Feel free to use the template in your own pelican-based websites.

To use the theme, it's done the same way as any other pelican theme. Just specify it as a parameter
when generating the blog, like so:

`$ pelican /path/to/your/content/folder -s path/to/your/pelicanconf.py -t path/to/your/theme`

Refer to the [Pelican documentation](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/tree/master/docs) for more
information.
