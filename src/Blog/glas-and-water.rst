I had a wonderful time in the studio of my mum. It took me around 2
hours to get all shots i wanted to. After that i experimented with some
coloured water and making bubbles. Here is the result: 

|Clear Water|
|Bubble Warp|
|Blue Colour in Water|

There are a few more images available on my flickr account. so long
