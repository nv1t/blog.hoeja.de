Because there's absolutly no information who or what is `@nuitgaspard`_
and how he get's his information: a small explanation. A few weeks ago i
was fascinated by the fact there can be GPS informationen stored inside
a picture. First, i thought this was uncommen and not overall used. But
nowadays, every smartphone has the ability to do so. Facebook, Twitter
itself and many other imagehosters delete this information from the
picture, or any information. Don't get me wrong, exif data is useful and
i like to see which camera model made the shot, but most people are
unaware of the potential of this exif-data. If there is gps information
stored inside and i don't want any location data published with this
picture, this data should get eliminated. I contacted twitpic about this
problem and never got an answer back. So i decided to show people what
is going on. Sorry i'm kinda harsh and sorry if it get's you, but you
are the unlucky ones and probably should have a look, what you are
posting onto the web. If anybody wants more information on his account,
please contact me on twitter or with email. so long
