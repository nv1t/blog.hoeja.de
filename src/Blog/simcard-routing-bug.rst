i got an interesting bug with a mobile phone from my mum. In fact, it is
not a bug from the phone itself. Imagine, you are upgrading your phone
and want to stay with your number. but you get a new one as well. so we
have the following setup: two phones with different simcards from
different suppliers (mobile A, and B). You have 2 different numbers, x
and y. Now: my mum wanted, the old number y working with the new phone A
as well. And so it does. Mobile A is working fine with both numbers, if
you phone them. It's ringing as usual and if you phone out it sends the
new number x. But, a sms to the old number doesn't arrive at the new
phone. Sending a sms to number x arrives at phone A and to number y at
phone B. haeh? now i'm completly stunned...it seems if you change your
card you only get some kind of number routing, if your contract is still
running But apparently they messed up. The number y is only partially
forwarded to the new phone. Come on...what's happening... hack: thought
about putting the old simcard into a phone connecting to my homeserver
and forwarding all sms by mail, or by my sms-flat... it's
frustrating...really frustrating. i made a short video to explain all
this and show you: kinda clouded: so long
