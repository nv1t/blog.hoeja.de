Some time ago, i decided to take an old rack with drawers into my new
home. My brother owned it and it was full with his stuff. After deciding
what he wanted to keep, he told me, i can through the stuff out. So it
was standing full as ever about a year in my apartment until today. I
went piece by piece through his stuff and discovered very nice things.
One of them, i decided to keep was a "book". It was closed, and sewn
into some kind of fabric with notes on each side. Nobody opened it yet
and i was kind of curious, because there was a little text on it:

I was afraid to rip or cut it
open. The seam is really neat and i didn't want to destroy it. But in
the end, my curiosity won big time! And i was even more impressed in
what i found inside. There were 75 cards of the size 8.5x4.7cm. All of
them had a page number and nearly all of them some text on it. You can
say it is a book.

Because i didn't want to explain or
analyze the text, i asked the creator if i could post it here, and she
agreed, and i'm happy about it. :) Every line represents a card. Empty
lines are empty cards.

    i'm afraid. i'm afraid of **lots** of things. i'm afraid of throwing
    up. when i think i might throw up, i lie on my couch. i usually quit
    breathing then. i panic. a real kind of panic. i get panic symptoms.
    those symptoms are: sweating, knit brows, racing heartbeats...
    ...trembles+shakes, chest pains, not getting enough air, feeling
    **hot**, dizziness and ... **TERROR** that almost paralyzing. i've
    got all of that. i'm open about my "condition". i tell people about
    it right off the bat. that way it's **out** there, you know? i tell
    people: "i get panic attacks". i say: "i get **so** HOT, my glasses
    -- they steam up!" a lot of people say: "really? that's insance!"
    some people say: "i think i've had one of those..." to that i say:
    "did you feel like you were going crazy?" "i mean it, **really**.
    Did you feel like you were going crazy?" most people change the
    subject at this point, or they look around. so... what else am i
    afraid of? [still thinking] oh ok. i know. here: i'm afraid of rats.
    i'm afraid of snakes, sharks, ghosts, aids, mad cow, being
    infertile, overdrawing on my checking account, terrorism. i'm afraid
    that i'm not funny **at all**, that my hair will fall out. i'm
    **always** afraid that someone is mad at me. when i was small, both
    my mom and dad would get angry at the **drop of a hat!** i was
    afraid then to do anything that'd set them off. so i held my breat
    **a lot**. i spent a lot of time in my closet back then. i felt far
    away and safe in there. i don't hide in closets anymore. but i still
    worry about people getting mad at me and i still hold my breat a
    lot! i'm afraid of not getting enough to eat... and of being
    **fat**. i'm afraid of being ugly and of being misunderstood. i'm
    afraid of illnesses, cancer, **for sure**. i'm afraid of this one
    virus that **attacks your nerves**. my friend, l. fraga, her dad has
    it. he has a hard time talking, eating, walking now. l. fraga wrote
    me a letter. in it she said: "i hate to see him now. it's so hard."
    then she said: "pray for him, if you pray." i don't pray. not ever.
    but just for her and for her dad, i tried it. i said to myself, i
    sad: "o.k." "i hope that l. fraga's dad gets better. i hope he can
    eat and talk and walk normally again. and soon because, he must be
    so **afraid**. wouldn't you be? bonus: what are you afraid of?

After reading this, i wanted to find out who wrote it. First, i thought
about some kind of present from a girlfriend. It could be some kind of
present, but it wasn't handcrafted by any girlfriend. I discovered it
was written and sewn together by `Shaina Feinberg (www.f-berg.org)`_.
She told me, she stopped making them about 6 years ago. My brother never
went to America, he never visited New York. Where the hack did he get
this from? Probably i will ask him later. The bonus were 8 empty
cards. So i finish what she intended to start:

    i'm afraid, i'm afraid of not beeing recognised or simply
    categorized. i'm afraid of shattering doors in the storm of heat, of
    built up anger which comes out and things which should never be
    said. i'm afraid of loosing friends because words can hurt. 
    but not saying them even more.

I really, really enjoyed it. It made my day! :) I will probably sew it
back together and give it to somebody else, if he/she needs it.
Hopefully it goes on and on! Thank you Shaina. Thank you for this
wonderful piece of art! so long
