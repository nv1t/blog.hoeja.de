I'm so sorry for not posting any development at the moment. I don't have
any time working on stuff on my own. BUT, i have a project... I don't
want to brag about it and i won't have the time to explain it in the
next few days. My personal life is much more important than any security
system, or software i will ever come across :) therefore, everything
goes on kinda slow at the moment. hopefully, i'm going to write some new
stuff and findings on different rfid systems and/or software security :)
so long
