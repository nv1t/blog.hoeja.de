:tags: en, there i fixed it

i disassembled my signo phone today. i wanted to know if it fits into a
baby play phone or something similar. and...what to do you..it
fits...20x20 is the phone it has to fit into. The plate is 18x8 or
something. A good friend of mine wants a phone as birthday present. It's
pretty easy to buy a phone...but not anybody has a playphone which
really works. Think about it. Your number would be: "Muh, Maeh, Miau,
Wuff, Wuff" or something similar. I think it's pretty cool...so i tried
to get my hands on such a phone.

i was talking to a friend of mine, and an
interesting idea came up: let's build a selfmade see-through telephone.
it's straight forward:

#. Buy a telephone
#. buy a see-through box
#. disassemble the phone
#. fit it into the box
#. set up the wiring, so you can dial from the outside

and you should be fine with that. it's a real phone, soooo...if you
don't mess up with the wiring it should work :) i'm going to the local
hardware store tmrw and have a look what i'm gonna need and buy..has to
be cheap. so long
