Es kommt immer oefter vor, dass ich bei `pastebin.com`_ ueber poetische
Elemente stolpere. Einige posten da Kurzgeschichten, Gedichte und
aehnliches. Auch das finde ich aussergewoehnlich und sollte gewuerdigt
werden. Vorallem ist es in der Datenflut schwer zu finden. Hier ist
eines, welches ich heute gefunden habe:

    Helen of Winchester, or Joan of Franklin. Can I please her with just
    crude words? (she forgives a wry smile she pities me as I stutter
    through this). She has too much of my poetry she has to be sick of
    it by now but she knows this secret place is where I thrive hidden
    in the battered paper of fearless love letters and sleeping between
    the lines of youth's miscalculated poetry that place that we have
    always shared (she won't approve of such sentimental lines). Damn
    this, I had all week to work on it and damn the faint bitterness of
    all farewells but bless, dammit bless, this life of hers. Bless her
    house, bless her feet bless the bed she crawls into and the blinds
    she closes shut bless the door on her way out bless her every which
    way she goes. Forget the wind, the roads, and all the rivers leading
    home she'll carry herself there when she damn well feels like it
